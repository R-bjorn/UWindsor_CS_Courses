I added the print statement in a for loop inside runcommand.c .. 
because thats's where we are using execvp that prints all the info about the file. 

And the reason why I added the print statement there is because we are using execvp 
and as we discussed in about execvp and all the exec functions that execvp needs two parameters 
first is filename and second is an array of char which includes all the commands.
So I used a for loop to print all that array of char data because i know that execvp has 
cline as a second parameter and cline is a char array. so it contains all the command data.
