In the copy.c file.. there are some bugs that needs to be fixed. 
also when reading the file, it was 512 bytes which was out of bound for buffer char array. 
when writing, the code should only write n1 bytes, but the previous code had 100. that was also the problem.
and in the while loop, when the curser was at the end of the file, it reads some garbage values. 
that's why i used do while loop.
