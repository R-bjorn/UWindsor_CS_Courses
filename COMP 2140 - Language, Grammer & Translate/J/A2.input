MAIN f() 
BEGIN 
  you are not required to check the syntax of the program; 
     so all these words are identifiers;
  except "quoted" strings and keywords; 
  
  to check how many lines and words I have;
     type "wc A2.input" in "luna.cs";
     your number of characters and lines may vary from sample output, 
     depends on how you save this file;
     
  to count the identifers and keywords;
      you have to count me one by one;
  note that A1_A2 is not ONE identifier;
	as defined in the language lexicon specification;
	A1 and A2 should returned as two identifiers;
  special characters such as !@#$%	and tab 
        may also appear to test your program;
  both 123 and 123.45 are numbers;
  	while 12,34 are two numbers;
/** you can put more than one comment line with characters like * and )  **/

  here is some more tricky part: 
  " /** this is a quoted string **/ "  but /** "this is a comment " **/
END
